<h1>Welcome to LolaDrives!</h1>

     <p>Thank you for joining us in our research endeavour aiming at making real driving emission tests available to
         everyone!
         Please
         read and accept the
         following
         disclaimer to get started.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
     <p>
         We put a lot of effort into the development, testing and quality-assurance of LolaDrives.
         However, you use this app at your own risk. We are not liable to possible damages of any kind caused before,
         during or after using LolaDrives.
     </p>
     <p>
         RDE tests can be conducted only if the car's OBD-II interface provides all the required data. This is not
         guaranteed to be the case for your car. Thus, we cannot assure that all features of LolaDrives work
         flawlessly for you. We hope to soon be able to provide lists of car models for which the app is known to
         (not) work. </p>
     <p>
         RDE tests with LolaDrives do not meet all regulatory conditions.
     </p>
